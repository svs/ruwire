Ruwire is a patchbay and connection handler for Jack clients and is extension of Alex Norman's excellent jackcpp (http://www.x37v.info/jack_cpp/). Alex has very helpfully provided a SWIG interface to Ruby, and I have taken advantage of this to extend the ruby interface to jack.

Configurations can be stored in yml files. Please check guitar.yml in swig/ directory for an example.

The Ruwire class usage is very simple.

require 'ruwire'
r = Ruwire.new
r.load("guitar")

INSTALL
To install, please read "README_jackcpp". Basically you have to run "make ruby", then go into swig directory and read ruwire.rb and wire.rb. Then, run wire.rb from the swig directory. Make sure jack server is running. wire.rb should start rakarrack and rosegarden if they are installed and will then connect them based on the connections in the YML file.
